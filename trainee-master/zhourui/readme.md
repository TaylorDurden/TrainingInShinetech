3. After the team understood the requirement clearly, we discussed requirement again and assigned works to everyone, I was assigned to write the framework, which work I planed took 1.5 days, but now I felt not enough, because I took long time to debug a problem with missing a reference, I will catch the progress tomorrow.

3. After I finished all pages, I started to add modal pages and JS validating function, All the modal pages were finished with a little problems, and the editing page not finished yet, when I want to catch the table data, I was confused of using JS script, after I referenced some article online, I understood in general, will try this weekend.
4. In process of writing JS validating function, at first I validated every page in every JS function, then I found functions amount will be large along with pages amount, it's difficult to develop in future, so I validated all input controls in one JS function, by checking type attribute of input control with switch statement, basically implemented validating all pages in one JS function, decreased the workload, though the function was not perfect, but I felt improve a lot.

ar).

4. After listened HTML and CSS training by Jack Wang, I understood HTML,CSS more deeply, and I will try my best to avoid these mistakes, make HTML more easier and readable, make CSS naming more standardization, though the content of training were easy, but I was impressed by it, and it was what I need. I feel sorry about forgot to add this paragraph, because my thinking was filled with user authorizing today.
